# gatsby-transformer-giffit (temp name)

This transformer shall interact with another plugin I just develop pertaining 
GIFs and return a fixed / fluid structure like `gatsby-transformer-sharp`.

Any help would be wholeheartedly appreciated!

P.S.: "-giffit" is a development name, I'm open for suggestions. Though 
"-gif2webp" just sounds a little lame - what do you think (as "gifme" is already 
a thing ; )?
